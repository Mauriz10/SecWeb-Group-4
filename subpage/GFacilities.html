		<h2>Facilities</h2>
		<p>Our company has two facilities: the office and the warehouse. If either were to be compromised by an individual with malicious intent, the damage to our own as well as our partners physical assets not to mention digital assets could be very high. By securing access to the physical space, access to digital entry points is secured as well. Remember, the warehouse is a shared space and any chain is only ever as strong as its weakest link so keeping up to date and in co-operation with the practices and systems of our partners is key. </p> 
		<p>Considering the age of the building and the various parties operating in it, penetration testing must be performed on a regular schedule. This means hiring a team of professionals to attempt to gain access to it through common and specific methods typically used by criminals. Methods laid out in this guide can be amended accordingly.  </p>
		<p>Doors must only be accessible with proper credentials, I.e. ID tag and keys for electric locks. In case something suspicious happens, it will be helpful to have logs showing whose ID was used, where, and when. When different areas are restricted to a certain level of employee, it is important that all access points aka doors are at the same level of access. Again, the chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  </p>
		<p>Rooms, connecting corridors and the area surrounding the building should be monitored with recording security cameras. The footage will be available only to appropriate professionals (security staff) and saved for later review, just like with access logs of doors. </p>
