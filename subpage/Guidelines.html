			<h2>Process and work guidelines</h2>
			<p>The way things are done and performed as just as important as any physical lock and key for company security. At the end of the day the line of defense is always people, as any physical structure is only a deterrent and a speed bump for a determined malicious actor physically present at the premises. Professional security guards who are available to respond in a timely manner are therefore a necessity in the security of our facilities.  </p>
            <p>Considering our warehouse is a shared space with our partners, all practices must be matched with their practices to work. If a malicious actor can gain access through one of our partners all of the fancy security we have in place will be moot.  </p>
			<p>Appropriate safety gear must be worn when required. In the warehouse, this means hard hat and safety vest.  </p>
			<p>As mentioned in facilities, ID tags are to be worn at all times. This enables everyone to see the level of access that others have and can therefore identify whether or not others have the appropriate level of access rights. Guests will be given a visitor pass that must be worn in a an easily visible place. As with all practices, if wearing ID becomes irregular to the point that people pay no mind if they see someone without one, this entire method becomes ineffective as anyone without access could just be free to move around without calling attention to themselves.  </p>
			<p>Staff turnover is a common point of failure when it comes to security policy. As new hires come in, they must be trained by a more senior employee and given access to this material. When an employee leaves the job, they must turn in all company property (especially keys and ID) without opportunity for misuse after they are made aware their employment is coming to an end.  </p>
